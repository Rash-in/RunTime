# RunTime
Tooling repo for application projects that I start.

Example usage. Python virtual environments that I create for projects. I symlink this cloned repo. It houses all my certs, dotenv files, app logs, and pids. I point my application configs to use this inside the .env folder and don't need to re-create it for every project I develop. I have all the files I added to the .gitignore so they never get commited. Just the folder structure exists for the purpose of this repo.
